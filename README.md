## Email/SMS Spam Classification Project

This project aims to classify SMS messages as either spam or not spam using machine learning techniques. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and performance evaluation.

### Introduction

With the increasing amount of spam messages received by users on a daily basis, it has become essential to develop efficient techniques to filter out such unwanted messages. This project utilizes natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to automatically classify SMS messages as spam or not spam.

### Project Structure

The project consists of the following main components:

1. **Data Cleaning**: The dataset is cleaned by removing unnecessary columns and handling missing values and duplicates.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: This step involves analyzing the distribution of spam and ham (not spam) messages, visualizing the data, and extracting statistical information.

3. **Data Preprocessing**: The text data is preprocessed by converting it to lowercase, tokenizing, removing special characters, stopwords, and punctuation, and performing stemming.

4. **Model Building**: Several machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Bagging, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost are trained and evaluated for their performance in classifying spam messages.

5. **Model Evaluation**: The models are evaluated based on accuracy and precision scores, and the best-performing model is selected.

6. **Improving the Model**: Various techniques such as feature scaling, feature engineering, and ensemble methods like Voting Classifier and Stacking Classifier are employed to further improve the model's performance.

7. **Prediction**: Finally, the trained model is used to predict whether a given SMS message is spam or not spam.

### How to Use

To utilize this project for spam classification:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system along with necessary libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and XGBoost.
2. Download or clone the project repository from GitHub.
3. Open the `.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
4. Run the notebook cell by cell, following the instructions provided in the comments.
5. Preprocess your own SMS message using the provided preprocessing function.
6. Utilize the trained model to predict whether your message is spam or not spam.

### Conclusion

Spam classification is a crucial task in ensuring a better user experience and data security. This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in automatically detecting and filtering out spam messages from SMS data. By leveraging NLP techniques and various machine learning algorithms, we can develop robust and accurate spam classification systems.
